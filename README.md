This file will assist you in determining  
if there is a person in the photo   
and recognizing their actions,  
while also displaying the training results through a validity graph.
In order for this model to work correctly,   
upload a file containing many examples of a person's image,  
and even better, if they are sorted into many files   
and signed by name.  
then the training of the model will go very well
